### [Research](http://nw-anderson.github.io/nw-anderson_research.github.io/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been a researcher in the lab of Dr. Heath Blackmon (Dept. of Biology) since 2017. The lab has a broad focus in evolutionary biology but much of the research focuses on sex chromosomes, genome structure, and population genetics. My work has focused on recombination rate evolution, phylogenetics and population genetic modelling, statistical methods for analysis of of trait evolution. Namely, the development of multi locus simulation of sexually antagonistic alleles under complex sex determination and recombination systems, and the statistical analysis of discrete and continuous trait evolution in a phylogenetic framework. I also lead a large scale experimental evolution project studying recombination rate adaptation to multilocus selection and changes in population structure.

### [The Blackmon Lab](http://coleoguy.github.io)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blackmon Lab is in the Biology Department at Texas A&M University. We have two broad areas of inquiry. The first is genome evolution, specifically sex chromosome and structural evolution. The second is the development of methods and databases that accelerate the analysis of data within a quantitative genetic or phylogenetic framework. To address these topics, we use a broad range of approaches including theoretical population genetics, bioinformatics, genomics, and molecular cytogenetics. Although we have projects involving all types of organisms, we often study beetles, and we keep several species in the lab as model organisms.
