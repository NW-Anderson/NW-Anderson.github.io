### Current Projects


* **How much water is in the fountain of youth?** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among species that have separate sexes, sex chromosomes are nearly ubiquitous and yet
there are many unanswered question with regard to their evolutionary dynamics. XY
sex chromosome systems are one of the most common methods of sex determination and
have long interested researchers. Normally X and Y chromosomes differentiate over time
as the Y chromosome decays. However, not all species experience this Y decay. The
fountain of youth hypothesis suggests that imperfect sexual development and deleterious
mutations on Y chromosomes may act together as a force to maintain homology between
the X and Y. However, the viability of the fountain of youth hypothesis has not been well
explored mathematically. Using both finite and infinite population genetic models we have
shown that this process cannot completely eliminate sexually antagonistic selection â€“ the
force that is thought to lead to the decay of Y chromosomes. Using our modeling approach
we are able to determine the parameter space under which the fountain of youth can and
cannot preserve similarity between the X and Y chromosome. These results appear to
support fountain of youth hypothesis by showing the limits to the canonical model of
sex chromosome evolution and grant insight into the fitness effect of sex chromosome
inversions.

* **Ancestral state test: a method for inferring the impact of causal relationships between continuous and discrete trait evolution.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-evolutionary relationships where the value of a continuous trait affects the evolution of a discrete trait remain difficult to study.  We present a novel comparative method, to be included in the existing R package evobiR, that tests whether a discrete trait transitions when a continuous trait has values more extreme than expected if both traits were evolving independently.  We show that this approach has acceptable type 1 error rates, even when its assumptions are violated, but has low power unless the number of taxa is large. Finally we compare this approach to existing methods that can be used to explore similar hypotheses.  The types of questions that this approach allows us to test are common in evolutionary biology and, unlike existing approaches, the ancestral condition test uses all available data and provides more information than existing methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You probably don't want the present guide to be the front page of your website, so you should edit the `index.md` file. You probably also want to edit or delete the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` files.

Aside from that you can of course create new pages and posts like with any Jekyll website by refering to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/).
