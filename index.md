### [Research](http://nw-anderson.github.io/nw-anderson_research.github.io/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I have been a researcher in the lab of Dr. Heath Blackmon (Dept. of Biology) since 2017. The lab has a broad focus in evolutionary biology but much of the research focuses on sex chromosomes, genome structure, and population genetics. My work has focused on recombination rate evolution, phylogenetics and population genetic modelling, statistical methods for analysis of of trait evolution. Namely, the development of multi locus simulation of sexually antagonistic alleles under complex sex determination and recombination systems, and the statistical analysis of discrete and continuous trait evolution in a phylogenetic framework. I also lead a large scale experimental evolution project studying recombination rate adaptation to multilocus selection and changes in population structure.
