### [Research](http://nw-anderson.github.io/nw-anderson_research.github.io/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a PhD student in the lab of Dr Aaron Ragsdale (Dept. of Integrative Biology) at UW - Madison since Summer of 2022. The lab studies human history, domographic inference and broad areas of theoretical population genetics. My long term goal is to understand how selection on high-level phenotypes translates to interactions and/or interference at the genomic level. In particular, I wish to model how changing demography, selection and linkage influence genomic variation. Such models can be leveraged to find the most likely demographic and selective history of a population without resorting to forward-in-time simulations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I worked in the lab of Dr. Carol Lee. Which studies climate-adaptation and range expansions in marine copepods. My work focuses on the development of association methods targeting gene-environment interactions and the modelling of complex trait evolution in a changing environment. During my undergrad, I had been a researcher in the lab of Dr. Heath Blackmon (Texas A&M University; Dept. of Biology) from 2017 to Spring 2020. The lab has a broad focus in evolutionary biology but much of the research focuses on sex chromosomes, genome structure, and population genetics. My work had focused on phylogenetics and population genetic modelling. Namely, the development of multi locus simulation of sexually antagonistic alleles under complex sex determination and recombination systems, and the statistical analysis of discrete and continuous trait evolution in a phylogenetic framework.
